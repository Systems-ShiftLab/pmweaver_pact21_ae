/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__
			Extensions to ISO C99 from TR 27431-2:2010.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-1:2014.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-4:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-3:2015.

   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, always long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

/* Arch-specific definitions.  Each architecture must define the following
   macros to define the expected sizes of pthread data types:

   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_ATTR_T        - size of pthread_attr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEX_T       - size of pthread_mutex_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_T   - size of pthread_mutexattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_COND_T        - size of pthread_cond_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_CONDATTR_T    - size of pthread_condattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_RWLOCK_T      - size of pthread_rwlock_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_T  - size of pthread_rwlockattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIER_T     - size of pthread_barrier_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_T - size of pthread_barrierattr_t.

   Also, the following macros must be define for internal pthread_mutex_t
   struct definitions (struct __pthread_mutex_s):

   __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_MID   - any additional members after 'kind'
				    and before '__spin' (for 64 bits) or
				    '__nusers' (for 32 bits).
   __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_END   - any additional members at the end of
				    the internal structure.
   __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION   - 1 if the architecture supports lock
				    elision or 0 otherwise.
   __PTHREAD_MUTEX_NUSERS_AFTER_KIND - control where to put __nusers.  The
				       preferred value for new architectures
				       is 0.
   __PTHREAD_MUTEX_USE_UNION      - control whether internal __spins and
				    __list will be place inside a union for
				    linuxthreads compatibility.
				    The preferred value for new architectures
				    is 0.

   For a new port the preferred values for the required defines are:

   #define __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_MID
   #define __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_END
   #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION         0
   #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_NUSERS_AFTER_KIND    0
   #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_USE_UNION            0

   __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION can be set to 1 if the hardware plans to
   eventually support lock elision using transactional memory.

   The additional macro defines any constraint for the lock alignment
   inside the thread structures:

   __LOCK_ALIGNMENT - for internal lock/futex usage.

   Same idea but for the once locking primitive:

   __ONCE_ALIGNMENT - for pthread_once_t/once_flag definition.

   And finally the internal pthread_rwlock_t (struct __pthread_rwlock_arch_t)
   must be defined.

 * Allocation class interface
 *
 * When requesting an object from the allocator, the first step is to determine
 * which allocation class best approximates the size of the object.
 * Once found, the appropriate free list, called bucket, for that
 * class is selected in a fashion that minimizes contention between threads.
 * Depending on the requested size and the allocation class, it might happen
 * that the object size (including required metadata) would be bigger than the
 * allocation class size - called unit size. In those situations, the object is
 * constructed from two or more units (up to 64).
 *
 * If the requested number of units cannot be retrieved from the selected
 * bucket, the thread reaches out to the global, shared, heap which manages
 * memory in 256 kilobyte chunks and gives it out in a best-fit fashion. This
 * operation must be performed under an exclusive lock.
 * Once the thread is in the possession of a chunk, the lock is dropped, and the
 * memory is split into units that repopulate the bucket.
 *
 * These are the CTL entry points that control allocation classes:
 * - heap.alloc_class.[class_id].desc
 *	Creates/retrieves allocation class information
 *
 * It's VERY important to remember that the allocation classes are a RUNTIME
 * property of the allocator - they are NOT stored persistently in the pool.
 * It's recommended to always create custom allocation classes immediately after
 * creating or opening the pool, before any use.
 * If there are existing objects created using a class that is no longer stored
 * in the runtime state of the allocator, they can be normally freed, but
 * allocating equivalent objects will be done using the allocation class that
 * is currently defined for that size.
 *
 * Please see the libpmemobj man page for more information about entry points.
