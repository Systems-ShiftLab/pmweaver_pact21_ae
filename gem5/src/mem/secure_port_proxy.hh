/**

 * PortProxy Object Declaration.
 *
 * Port proxies are used when non-structural entities need access to
 * the memory system (or structural entities that want to peak into
 * the memory system without making a real memory access).
 *
 * Proxy objects replace the previous FunctionalPort, TranslatingPort
 * and VirtualPort objects, which provided the same functionality as
 * the proxies, but were instances of ports not corresponding to real
 * structural ports of the simulated system. Via the port proxies all
 * the accesses go through an actual port (either the system port,
 * e.g. for processes or initialisation, or a the data port of the
 * CPU, e.g. for threads) and thus are transparent to a potentially
 * distributed memory and automatically adhere to the memory map of
 * the system.
